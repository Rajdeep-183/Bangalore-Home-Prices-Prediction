# Bangalore Home Prices Prediction System

A Machine Learning project that predicts home prices in Bangalore based on various input features like location, size, number of bedrooms, etc.

Built using Python, Flask for the backend, Scikit-learn for the Machine Learning model, and simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the frontend.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This system allows users to input home features and get a predicted price for properties in Bangalore.  
It consists of three main components:
1. **Client** – User interface to input data and display predictions.
2. **Server** – Flask-based backend API that processes requests and interacts with the ML model.
3. **Model** – Pre-trained Scikit-learn regression model for predicting home prices.
